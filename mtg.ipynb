Since **Humility**'s effect is applied in Layer 6, which comes after Layer 4 where **Opalescence**'s effect is applied, the effect of **Humility** takes precedence. This ruling ensures that all creatures on the battlefield will have their abilities removed and their power and toughness set to 1/1.\n"

Since Opalescence's effect is applied in layer 4 before Humility's effect in layer 7b, the creatures will be affected by Opalescence first, becoming creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value.
