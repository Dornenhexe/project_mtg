1. Oracle texts:
- Humility: "All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1."
- Opalescence: "Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value."

2. I choose to apply the Timestamp rule (613.1 to 613.7) in this case.

3. Quoting the rule:
- From Document(page_content='613.9. One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does. Example: Two effects are affecting the same creature: one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” and one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature loses flying.” Neither of these depends on the other, since nothing changes what they affect or what they’re doing to it. Applying them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last “wins.” The same process would be followed, and the same result reached, if either of the effects had a duration (such as “Target creature loses flying until end of turn”) or came from a non-Aura source (such as “All creatures lose flying”). Example: One effect reads, “White creatures get +1/+1,” and another reads, “Enchanted creature is white.” The enchanted creature gets +1/+1 from the first effect, regardless of its previous color.', metadata={'source': './data/rules.txt'})

4. Explanation:
- The Timestamp rule states that when two continuous effects are in conflict, the one that was generated last "wins." In this case, Humility was played first and then Opalescence was played, so Opalescence has the later timestamp.

5. Judging:
- The continuous effect of Opalescence, which turns each other non-Aura enchantment into a creature with power and toughness equal to its mana value, would be applied in the game.
