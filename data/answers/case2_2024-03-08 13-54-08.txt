1. Oracle texts:
- Humility: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.
- Opalescence: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value.

2. The effects of these cards are applied in different layers according to the layer system in Magic: the Gathering. The effect of Humility, which removes all creature abilities and sets their power and toughness to 1/1, is applied in Layer 6 (ability-removing effects) and Layer 7b (power/toughness setting effects). On the other hand, the effect of Opalescence, which turns non-Aura enchantments into creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value, is applied in Layer 4 (type-changing effects) and Layer 7b (power/toughness setting effects).

3. I will use the rule of Overriding of effects (613.9) to determine which continuous effect takes precedence in this scenario.

4. Judging: The continuous effect of Humility, which sets all creatures' power and toughness to 1/1 and removes all abilities, will be applied in the game.

5. I decided this way because the effect of Humility specifically states that it removes all creature abilities and sets their power and toughness to 1/1. This effect is applied in Layer 6 and Layer 7b, which are relevant to ability removal and power/toughness setting. Since Humility has the earlier timestamp, its effect will override the effect of Opalescence in this case.

6. Rule used: Overriding of effects (613.9) - One continuous effect can override another, and the effect with the earlier timestamp takes precedence.
