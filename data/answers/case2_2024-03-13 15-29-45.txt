4. **Rule Choice: Layers (613.1 to 613.7)**
   - This rule governs the order in which continuous effects are applied based on the layers defined in the game.

5. **Judging Decision**:
   - Based on the chosen rule of Layers, the continuous effect of **Humility** will be applied in the game. This means that all creatures will lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.

6. **Explanation**:
   - The decision to apply the effect of **Humility** over **Opalescence** is based on the layer system in Magic: The Gathering. Since **Humility**'s effect is applied in Layer 6, which comes after Layer 4 where **Opalescence**'s effect is applied, the effect of **Humility** takes precedence. This ruling ensures that all creatures on the battlefield will have their abilities removed and their power and toughness set to 1/1.
