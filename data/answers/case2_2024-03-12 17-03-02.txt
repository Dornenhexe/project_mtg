1. Oracle texts and comments:
- Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth: Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types. Comments: Urborg's ability causes each land on the battlefield to have the land type Swamp. Any land that's a Swamp has the ability "{T}: Add {B}". If an effect such as that of Magus of the Moon causes Urborg to lose its abilities by setting it to a basic land type not in addition to its other types, it won't turn lands into Swamps.
- Blood Moon: Nonbasic lands are Mountains. Comments: Nonbasic lands will lose any other land types and abilities they had. They will gain the land type Mountain and gain the ability "{T}: Add {R}".

2. Determine the layer on which the effects of the cards are applied:
The effects of Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Blood Moon fall under the interaction of continuous effects, which are applied in layers according to the rules in 613.1.

3. Decide which rule to apply:
In this scenario, we will apply the rule of Dependency (613.8) as it deals with continuous effects that depend on one another.

4. Rule summary:
Dependency (613.8): Continuous effects are applied in dependency order, meaning that the effects are applied in a way that respects the dependencies between them.

5. Judging:
The continuous effect of Blood Moon, which turns nonbasic lands into Mountains, will be applied in the game. This is because the effect of Blood Moon does not depend on the effect of Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth, but rather stands on its own to change the land types.

6. Explanation:
In this case, the effect of Blood Moon takes precedence over Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth because it directly changes the land types to Mountains without being dependent on Urborg's effect. The Dependency rule ensures that effects are applied in a logical order that respects their dependencies, and in this scenario, the effect of Blood Moon is independent and therefore applied first.
