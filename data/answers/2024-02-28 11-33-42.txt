1. Oracle texts:
- Blood Moon: "Nonbasic lands are Mountains."
- Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth: "Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types."

2. Layer determination:
Both effects are type-changing effects, which are applied in layer 4 according to rule 613.1.

3. Judging:
The continuous effect of Blood Moon is applied in the game.

4. Explanation:
According to rule 613.9, when two continuous effects are affecting the same type of object, the effect generated last "wins." Since Blood Moon was played first and has an earlier timestamp, its effect of turning nonbasic lands into Mountains takes precedence over Urborg's effect of turning all lands into Swamps.

5. Rule quoted:
From rule 613.9: "Applying them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last 'wins.'"
