1. Oracle text of Humility: "All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1."
Oracle text of Opalescence: "Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value."

2. I would choose to apply the Timestamp and Layers rule (613.1 to 613.7) in this case.

3. Quoting the rule: "613.9. One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does. Applying them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last “wins.”"

4. I would apply this rule because it specifically addresses the situation where multiple continuous effects are in conflict, and it provides a clear guideline on how to resolve such conflicts based on the order in which the effects were generated.

5. In this case, Humility's effect of reducing all creatures' power and toughness to 1/1 would be applied first due to its earlier timestamp. Then, Opalescence's effect of turning non-Aura enchantments into creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value would be applied second.

6. Judging: The continuous effect of Humility, where all creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1, would be applied in the game over the continuous effect of Opalescence, where non-Aura enchantments become creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value.

6a. Effects:
- Humility: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.
- Opalescence: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value.
