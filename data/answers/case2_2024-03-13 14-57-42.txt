1. Oracle text and comments:
- Humility: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1. Comments: The interaction between Humility and Opalescence is described in detail, explaining the layering of effects and the resulting power and toughness changes.
- Opalescence: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value. Comments: The interaction between Opalescence and Humility is explained, including the timestamp order and the resulting power and toughness changes.

2. Layers on which the effects are applied:
The effects of Humility and Opalescence are applied in different layers according to the rules of Magic: The Gathering. These layers determine the order in which continuous effects are applied to game objects.

3. Chosen rule: Layers (613.1 to 613.7)
The rule of Layers is the most fitting in this situation as it governs the order in which continuous effects are applied to game objects. This rule will help determine the outcome of the interaction between Humility and Opalescence based on the layering of effects.

4. Summary of the rule:
The Layers rule (613.1 to 613.7) dictates the order in which continuous effects are applied to game objects in Magic: The Gathering. Effects are applied in a specific sequence of layers, with each layer determining different aspects of the game state.

5. Judging regarding the chosen rule:
Based on the Layers rule, the continuous effect of Opalescence will be applied in the game. This means that each other non-Aura enchantment will become a creature with base power and toughness equal to its mana value. In this case, the creatures affected by Opalescence will have their power and toughness determined by their mana value, overriding the effects of Humility.

6. Explanation:
By applying the Layers rule, we follow the specific sequence in which continuous effects are applied in Magic: The Gathering. In this scenario, Opalescence's effect takes precedence over Humility's effect, as it is applied in a layer that determines the power and toughness of creatures. Therefore, the outcome of the interaction will result in creatures becoming creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value, as dictated by Opalescence.
