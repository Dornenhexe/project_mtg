1. **Humility**
   - Oracle Text: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.
   - Comments: The interaction between Humility and Opalescence is detailed, explaining the layering of effects and the outcome based on timestamp order.

2. **Opalescence**
   - Oracle Text: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value.
   - Comments: The interaction between Opalescence and Humility is explained, including the impact of timestamp order on the outcome.

3. The layers on which the effects of the cards are applied are crucial in determining the outcome. According to the rules provided in 613.1 to 613.7, the layering of effects is essential in resolving conflicting continuous effects.

4. **Rule Chosen: Layers (613.1 to 613.7)**
   - The chosen rule focuses on the order in which continuous effects are applied based on specific layers, ensuring a structured resolution of conflicting effects.

5. **Judging:**
   - Based on the chosen rule of Layers (613.1 to 613.7), the continuous effect that takes precedence in the game between Humility and Opalescence is as follows:
     - Humility: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.
     - Opalescence: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature with power and toughness equal to its mana value.

6. **Explanation:**
   - By applying the rule of Layers (613.1 to 613.7), we can determine that the effect of Humility, which sets all creatures to 1/1 with no abilities, takes precedence over the effect of Opalescence, which turns enchantments into creatures with power and toughness based on their mana value. This decision is based on the specific layering of effects outlined in the rules, ensuring a clear resolution in the game.
