1. **Opalescence**:
   - Oracle Text: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value.
   - Comments: The interaction between Humility and Opalescence is explained, detailing the layering of effects and the outcomes based on timestamps.

2. **Humility**:
   - Oracle Text: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.
   - Comments: The interaction between Humility and Opalescence is described, including the layering of effects and the impact on creature abilities and power/toughness.

3. The effects of both cards are applied in different layers, as described in the rules 613.1 to 613.7.

4. **Rule of Choosing**: Layers (613.1 to 613.7)

5. **Judging**:
   The continuous effect of **Humility** is applied in the game. The effect states that all creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1. This means that regardless of the timestamp order, all creatures will be affected by Humility's effect, reducing their power and toughness to 1/1 and removing all abilities.

6. **Explanation**:
   In this scenario, the layering rules dictate that the effect of Humility takes precedence over Opalescence. Since Humility's effect applies to all creatures on the battlefield, it will override the power and toughness adjustments made by Opalescence. Therefore, all creatures will be 1/1 with no abilities due to the continuous effect of Humility.
