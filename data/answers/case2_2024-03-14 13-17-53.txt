1. **Opalescence**:
   - Oracle Text: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value.
   - Comments: The interaction between Humility and Opalescence is explained, detailing the effects on different layers depending on the timestamp order.

2. **Humility**:
   - Oracle Text: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.
   - Comments: The interaction between Humility and Opalescence is described, including the layering of effects and the impact on power and toughness.

3. The effects of both cards are applied in different layers. Opalescence's effect is applied in Layer 4, while Humility's effect is applied in Layer 6.

4. **Rule Choice: Layers (613.1 to 613.7)**
   - This rule governs the order in which continuous effects are applied based on the layers defined in the game.

5. **Judging Decision**:
   - According to the Layers rule, the effect of **Humility** takes precedence over **Opalescence** because it is applied in a higher layer (Layer 6 vs. Layer 4).
   - Therefore, in the final board state, all creatures will be 1/1 with no abilities, as dictated by Humility's effect.

6. **Explanation**:
   - The decision to apply the Layers rule is based on the understanding of how continuous effects interact in Magic: The Gathering. By following the layering system defined in the rules, we can determine the order in which effects are applied and resolve any conflicts between them.
   - In this case, Humility's effect of reducing all creatures to 1/1 with no abilities overrides Opalescence's effect of turning enchantments into creatures with power and toughness equal to their mana value.
   - This ruling ensures consistency and fairness in gameplay by following the established rules of the game.
