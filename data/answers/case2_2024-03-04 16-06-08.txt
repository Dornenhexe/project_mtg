1. Oracle texts:
- Humility: "All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1."
- Opalescence: "Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value."

2. The effects of these cards are applied in different layers. The layer system in Magic: the Gathering determines the order in which continuous effects are applied to objects. In this case, Humility's effect affects the characteristics of creatures in layer 6 (Ability Adding or Removing Effects), while Opalescence's effect affects the type-changing characteristic of enchantments in layer 4 (Type-Changing Effects).

3. The rule that is fitting in this case is the Layer system (613.1 to 613.7).

4. Judging: The continuous effect of Humility is applied in the game. The effect of Humility overrides the effect of Opalescence.

5. Explanation: According to the layer system, effects are applied in a specific order, and effects in higher layers take precedence over effects in lower layers. Since Humility's effect affects the abilities of creatures in a higher layer than Opalescence's effect on enchantments, Humility's effect will be applied first, causing all creatures to lose their abilities and become 1/1 creatures. Opalescence's effect on enchantments becoming creatures will then be applied, but since the creatures have already lost their abilities, they will remain as 1/1 creatures.

6. Rule used for decision: The Layer system (613.1 to 613.7) in Magic: the Gathering.
