1. Oracle texts:
- Opalescence: Each other non-Aura enchantment is a creature in addition to its other types and has base power and base toughness each equal to its mana value.
- Humility: All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.

2. The layer on which the effects of the cards are applied is Layer 4: Type-changing effects.

3. I choose the Timestamp rule.

4. Judging: The continuous effect of Humility is applied in the game. All creatures lose all abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1.

5. I decided this way because according to the Timestamp rule, the effect of the card played later takes precedence over the effect of the card played earlier.

6. Rule used for decision: Timestamp rule.
