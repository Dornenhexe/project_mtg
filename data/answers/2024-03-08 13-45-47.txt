1. Oracle texts:
- Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth: "Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types."
- Blood Moon: "Nonbasic lands are Mountains."

2. Layer determination:
The effects of these cards fall under the category of type-changing effects, which are applied in layer 4 according to rule 613.1.

3. Decision on ruling:
In this scenario, we will apply the rule of Dependency (613.8) as the effects of both cards are dependent on each other. The outcome of one effect (making lands Swamps) affects the outcome of the other effect (making nonbasic lands Mountains).

4. Judging:
The continuous effect of the card that is applied in the game is Blood Moon: "Nonbasic lands are Mountains."

5. Explanation:
Since the effects of Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Blood Moon are dependent on each other, we need to consider the dependency rule (613.8). In this case, the effect of Blood Moon overrides the effect of Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth because Blood Moon specifically states that nonbasic lands are Mountains, regardless of any other effects.

6. Rule quoted:
Dependency rule (613.8) from the Magic: the Gathering comprehensive rules.
