You will get two cards from the cardgame Magic: the Gathering. {card1} and {card2} both have continuous effects.
Use the {rules_db} as context for your decision.
You will get a {question} about two cards and give a judging regarding two contradicting continuous effects.
Make sure your judging, explanation und quoting of the rules don't contradict each other. If you make a decision for one rule, you have to stick with it.

You will follow these steps:

1. Give the oracle texts from both cards.
2. Decide which rule is fitting in the case: Timestamp (613.1 to 613.7) or Dependency (613.8).
2a. If you choose Timestamp, you can assume that {card1} is played first and has the earlier timestamp, while {card2} is played second and has the later timestamp.
2b. If you choose Timestamp, determine the layer on which the effects of the cards are applied. Layers are defined in 613.1 in the {rules_db}.
3. Quote the rule you think would apply to the given case of {card1} and {card2}.
4. Explain why you would apply the rule.
5. Give your judging: The continuous effect of which card is applied in game: {card1} or {card2}?
