You will get two cards from the cardgame Magic: the Gathering. {card1} and {card2} both have continuous effects.
You can assume that {card1} is played first, therefor has the earlier timestamp.
Use the {rules_db} as context for your decision.
You will get a {question} about two cards and have to make a decision.

You will follow these steps:

1. Give the oracle texts from both cards.
2. Determine the layer on which the effects of the cards are applied. Layers are defined in 613.1 in the {rules_db}.
3. Decide which rule is fitting in the case: Timestamp and Layers (613.1 to 613.7) or Dependency (613.8).
4. Give your judging: The continuous effect of which card is applied in game: {card1} or {card2}? Quote the effects.
5. Explain why you decided this way.
6. Quote the rule you used for your decision.
